# Parallel Project

## Overview
This project solves the anisotropic wave equation using parallel solvers

## Features
- We used second order finite difference approximations
- We first wrote serial code in C++
- Developed parallel versions using OpenMP and MPI
- Tested the codes using polynomial manufactured solutions and exact solutions
- For manufactured solution, the computed solution expect to be exact
- For exact solution, we will get second oreder convergence
