# EigenWave algorithm

## Overview
This project focuses on computing the eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of Laplace operator on different domains using Eigenwave algorithm. The work includes:

- Implemented EigenWave algorithm in MATLAB in 1D, 2D and on an Annulus
- Tested with various methods including: Power Iteration Method, Basic Arnoldi, Krylov-Schur (using eigs function in MATLAB)
