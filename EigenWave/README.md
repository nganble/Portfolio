# EigenWave Algorithm

## Overview
This project explores the computation of eigenvalues and eigenfunctions of the Laplace operator on various domains using the EigenWave algorithm.

## Features
- **Algorithm Implementation**:
  - Developed the EigenWave algorithm in MATLAB for domains in 1D, 2D, and an annulus.
- **Testing and Validation**:
  - Verified accuracy and convergence using:
    - Power Iteration Method
    - Basic Arnoldi Method
    - Krylov-Schur Method (via MATLAB's `eigs` function)
